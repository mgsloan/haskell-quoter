haskell-quoter
==============

This package allows you to construct HSE ASTs similarly to
Template Haskell's AST quotes (with haskell antiquotes),
except without the restriction of only splicing expressions /
patterns / types / declarations.  Hopefully soon, it will
also allow you to pattern match on ASTs and work with TH
ASTs.
